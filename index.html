  <p class="text-muted">It was so exciting because it was my first time at Main Event. They had all types of stuff they had arcade games, and restaurants with really good food, and they also had a place where you can walk around on the top(You can see it on the picture). After cashing in how many points I had, I bought a character from Rumble a animated movie. </p>

  <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i had visited in april 2017</h5>
<p class="text-muted">Mt. Olympus was terrifying and so awesome because of all the fun rides. The only sad thing was that some rides I couldn't go on because of my height, but I went on a ride called Hades which was bizarre. It was probably my most favorite ride even though that I didn't get wet when I went on it.</p>

<p>Ram slipped into the role tailor-made for him. As he has done lover boy roles and mass roles in his career, doing the role with dual shades turned out to be a cakewalk. While as a doctor he looked soft and handsome and his chemistry with Kriti Shetty appealed to all. Then as a tough police officer, he looked mass and rugged and took on Aadi Pinisetty. His body language, expressions, and emotions are good in both roles. He showed variations in these things as a doctor and as a police officer.</p>

<p>Siva Karthikeyan is the biggest highlight of the film as he showcases a different side to his personality. He as an army doctor evokes good comedy, drama, and carries the film on his shoulder. One can say that he has probably given the best performance of his career.</p>

<p>If you are a Kamal fan, this film is a feast for you. If you are a fan of some good performances, again Vikram is for you too. So whatever category you belong to, Vikram satisfies you for sure because of the master of acting, Kamal Haasan. Kamal gave an unbelievable performance throughout the film, particularly in the action scenes. His expressions are priceless. The first half of the film has very little screen presence of Kamal, but he is always there with his character. And when you get into second half, Kamal will grab all your attention towards him with spell bounding performance.
